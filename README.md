# Project Overview
A small e-commerce company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch, but keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability. I was tasked with performing a vulnerability assessment of the situation to communicate the potential risks to decision makers at the company. I created a written report that explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.

I included the following in my report:
- __A system description__ highlights the relevant components, architecture, and dependencies of the system being assessed.
- __Scope of the Assessment__  specifies the focus and boundaries of the assessment.
- __Purpose of the Assessment__  which helps stakeholders understand the underlying objective and intended outcome of the analysis.
- __Risk Assessment__ .
